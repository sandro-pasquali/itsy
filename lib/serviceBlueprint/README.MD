Itsy Services
=============

This package was generated by Itsy. You should change it to fit your needs. Primarily:

1. Change the `/index.js` file. This is your service file. You will see that it is simply a harness around a function that receives a callback function. You should write a service that does something useful (like generate a value to fulfill the null key this service should be reacting to) and when you are done call the callback function (with a generated value if this service is responding to a null key)
2. Change the `test/index.js` file. Your service should be fully tested -- this is for your benefit.
